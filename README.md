# ReactiveLoad

This is a reactive load design project, the purpose of the reactive load is to simulate a speaker load for a guitar amplifier.
The design is based on two 8ohm loads, the two loads are connected through a switching mechanism that allows the user to select a 4ohm, 8ohm or 16ohm mode of operation.

a more detailed discussion of the design can be found in Design.pdf\n
LTSpice simulations can be found under the spice directory.
